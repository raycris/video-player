# Video player

In our project, we will allow users to toggle through several different videos using a radio input. 

In particular, we will learn how to pass down functions to update state in the parent components from the child component. This pattern is called lifting state up and is a very important pattern to know in React. We have a few button that maybe you'll need to play video in loop or play automatically
